#summary Android Market Sales Plotter
#labels Featured

This app graphs revenue from the Android Market over time. Using the same method as [http://www.anddev.org/viewtopic.php?p=30732 described here], this app fetches sales records from Google Checkout, then creates a histogram of them to be plotted with ChartDroid.

You can [http://code.google.com/p/chartdroid/source/browse/#svn/trunk/market_sales browse the code here].

== Why prompt for a password instead of obtaining credentials through AccountManager? ==
I made an attempt to use AccountManager, but this was unsuccessful.  The "service name" for Google Checkout is "sierra".  I was able to use this to programmatically obtain an "authtoken", but what is really needed in order to access the Google Checkout records is a value called "gdToken".  Unfortunately, although they are the same length, the "authoken" value cannot substitute for the "gdToken".
