  * smaller client application size
  * lets you use data directly from your database with SQLite queries in your Content Provider
  * receives updates (visual improvements or bugfixes) independently of the client application
  * uses resource files (XML layouts especially) without polluting resource namespace of client application (c.f. "[http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#libraryProject library projects]")
