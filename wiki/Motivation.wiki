#summary Motivation for the ChartDroid project

There exists a `.jar`-based library for charting in Android (from which *`ChartDroid`* branched), so why take the separate `.apk` approach?

  * smaller client application size
  * let's you use data directly from your database with SQLite queries in your Content Provider
  * updates independently of the client application
  * uses resource files (XML layouts especially) without polluting resource namespace of client application (c.f. "[http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#libraryProject library projects]")
